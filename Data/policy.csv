In particular, highways can be barriers to wildlife movement, leading to genetic diversity loss, inbreeding, and increased extinction risk for small, isolated populations on either side. The effects that highways have on wildlife movement can be variable, dependent on the unique dispersal behaviors of individual species. In this study, we test the hypothesis that highways will pose less of a barrier to coyotes, a species tolerant of human disturbance, than to gray fox, a species more sensitive to disturbance. We used landscape genetic tools to determine whether State Route 49, part of the California Essential Habitat Connectivity Project, was a barrier to coyote or gray fox movements."

Motivated by environmental concerns and coming EU legislation, our vision is that Sweden should become the first country to implement national incentives for underwater noise mitigation. The technical aspects of ship underwater noise are relatively well known. At cruise speed, cavitation at the propeller is typically the dominant source of underwater noise, but this is not true for all ships. Standardised measurement methods exist but are costly to implement. Prediction models are useful for noise mapping and fleet-wide estimates but not sufficiently accurate for individual ships.

As countries scale up climate action, they face the challenge of expanding renewable power while tackling biodiversity loss. Transitioning away from fossil fuels can reduce climate-related pressure on biodiversity, but brings its own risks. Unless carefully managed, the expansion of renewable power could compromise biodiversity. This report synthesises evidence on biodiversity impacts from renewable power infrastructure, with a focus on solar power, wind power and power lines. It identifies opportunities for mainstreaming biodiversity into power sector planning and policy to deliver better outcomes for nature and the climate. Drawing on good practice insights from across the globe, the report offers governments recommendations to align renewable power expansion with biodiversity goals."

This report is the outcome of a joint effort of the IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute and the Swedish Maritime Administration that addresses this challenge. Motivated by environmental concerns and coming EU legislation, our vision is that Sweden should become the first country to implement national incentives for underwater noise mitigation. The technical aspects of ship underwater noise are relatively well known. At cruise speed, cavitation at the propeller is typically the dominant source of underwater noise, but this is not true for all ships. Standardised measurement methods exist but are costly to implement. Prediction models are useful for noise mapping and fleet-wide estimates but not sufficiently accurate for individual ships. The environmental impact of underwater noise from shipping has gained increased scientific attention in rec..."

Impact studies have primarily focused on sediment plumes and habitat destruction, leaving consequences of industrial-scale deep-sea mining noise largely unexplored. Many marine taxa, including invertebrates, fish, and mammals, rely on sound for communication, navigation, and predator avoidance. Our systematic literature review highlights that noise sensitivity is widespread across taxa, yet only 35 % of taxonomic classes known in the CCZ have been studied for noise impacts. Soniferous fish, which rely on acoustic communication, are particularly vulnerable to noise. Chronic exposure to mining noise may have cascading ecological consequences, disrupting key behaviors and physiological processes in an environment characterized by low anthropogenic stressors. By identifying knowledge gaps and quantifying taxa likely to be vulnerable to industrial noise, this review provides the foundation to guide evidence-based management required to safeguard deep-sea ecosystems. Given the uncertainty surrounding deep-sea biotic responses to prolonged noise exposure, we emphasize the urgent need for a transparent transfer of knowledge on noise characteristics of deep-sea mining. These data are essential for assessing risks from mining noise to species, communities, and ecosystem functions and services.",Biodiversity; Clarion-clipperton Zone; Deep-sea Mining; Marine Soundscape; Noise Pollution; Soniferous Species; Mammals; Marine Pollution; Risk Assessment; Clarion-clipperton Zone; Deep Sea; Deep-sea Mining; Depth Zones; Marine Soundscape; Mining Activities; Pacific Ocean; Potential Impacts; Soniferous Species; Soundscapes; Deep Sea Mining; Biodiversity; Deep Sea; Fish; Invertebrate; Mammal; Marine Ecosystem; Noise Pollution; Pollution Effect; Submarine Mining; Ecosystem; Habitat; Human Impact (environment); Industrial Noise; Long Term Exposure; Mining; Noise; Nonhuman; Pacific Ocean; Plume; Predator Avoidance; Review; Sea; Sediment; Adverse Event; Animal; Aquatic Species; Environmental Monitoring; Clarion Fracture Zone; Clipperton Fracture Zone; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Mining; Noise,Mammals; Marine pollution; Risk assessment; Clarion-Clipperton zone; Deep sea; Deep-sea mining; Depth zones; Marine soundscape; Mining activities; Pacific ocean; Potential impacts; Soniferous species; Soundscapes; Deep sea mining; biodiversity; deep sea; fish; invertebrate; mammal; marine ecosystem; noise pollution; pollution effect; submarine mining; ecosystem; habitat; human impact (environment); industrial noise; long term exposure; mining; noise; nonhuman; Pacific Ocean; plume; predator avoidance; review; sea; sediment; adverse event; animal; aquatic species; environmental monitoring; Clarion Fracture Zone; Clipperton Fracture Zone; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Mining; Noise,This work was supported in part by Synchronicity Earth [grant number G000942 ] and other members of Oceans Initiative's donor community.

It has long been recognized that there are marked variations in animals' sensitivity to noise disturbance across individuals and species and behavioral contexts for the same individuals. For biodiversity conservation and management, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms for the subject- and context-dependent responses of wildlife to human disturbances. Here we used meta-analysis and statistical models to understand the biological and ecological traits that may explain the differential responses of bats to anthropogenic noise. Bats, the second-largest order of mammals, play indispensable ecological roles but face various human threats. The literature survey revealed that only 33 studies had investigated the effects of anthropogenic noise on 60 bat species, representing approximately 4 % of the total bat species and being largely (92 %) restrained to the families Vespertilionidae and Molossidae. The statistical analyses revealed that transportation and urban noise were the more disturbing to bats. Bat species that forage in narrow and edge spaces were more sensitive to anthropogenic noise than those that forage in open spaces. Bat species using longer echolocation calls were more sensitive to noise disturbance. Furthermore, compared to orienting and vocalizing bats, foraging bats were more sensitive to noise disturbance. These data indicated that anthropogenic noise, particularly traffic noise, needs to be carefully managed for forests and other types of vegetation used by foraging bats.",Auditory Masking; Echolocating Bats; Habitat Selection; Meta-analysis; Noise Pollution; Anthropogenic Effect; Bat; Biodiversity; Conservation Management; Conservation Status; Echolocation; Habitat Selection; Meta-analysis; Noise Pollution,anthropogenic effect; bat; biodiversity; conservation management; conservation status; echolocation; habitat selection; meta-analysis; noise pollution,We thank Huan Ye and Qianyu Wang for their valuable discussions.

Aquatic animals such as fishes are subject to physiological stress induced by pollution present in aquatic systems, which can translate to changes in behaviour. Key adaptive behaviours such as shoaling and schooling may be subject to change as a result of physiological or metabolic stress or neurosensory impacts of pollution. This can result in fitness and ecological impacts such as increased predation risk and reduced foraging success. Here, we conducted a systematic metanalysis of the existing literature, comprising 165 studies, on the effects of anthropogenic pollution on sociability and group cohesion in fish species. Both organic (number of studies = 92, posterior mean (PM) = −0.483, p < 0.01) and inorganic (n = 24, PM = −1.453, p < 0.001) chemical pollutants, as well as light exposure (n = 21, PM = −3.038, p < 0.01) were found to reduce sociability. These pollutants did not reduce group cohesion, indicating that effects may be masked in group settings, though fewer studies were carried out on group cohesion and this is a key area for future research. Mixtures of chemical pollutants (n = 16) were found to reduce cohesion (PM = −43.71, p < 0.01), but increase sociability (PM = 44.27, p < 0.01). Evidence was found that fish may behaviourally acclimate to two forms of pollutant, namely mixed chemical pollutants (PM = −0.668, p < 0.01) and noise exposure (n = 22, PM = −4.043, p < 0.01). While aquatic systems are often subject to pollution from multiple sources and of multiple types, very few studies investigated the effects of multiple stressors concurrently. This review identifies trends in the existing literature, and highlights areas where further research is required in order to understand the behavioural and ecological impacts of anthropogenic pollutants in aquatic systems.","Chemical Pollution; Cohesion; Fish Behaviour; Pollution; Review; Sociability; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Abiotic; Fish; Haze Pollution; Invertebrates; Anthropogenic Pollutants; Aquatic System; Chemical Pollutants; Chemical Pollution; Cohesion; Fish Behavior; Group Cohesions; Physiological Stress; Posterior Means; Sociability; Anthropogenic; Heavy Metal; Inorganic Compound; Organic Compound; Anthropogenic Source; Behavioral Response; Chemical Pollutant; Ecological Impact; Fish; Literature Review; Meta-analysis; Pollution Effect; Anthropogenic Pollutant; Aquatic Environment; Chemical Pollution; Cyprinidae; Individual Sociability; Light Exposure; Meta Analysis; Metabolic Stress; Nonhuman; Physiological Stress; Pollutant; Pollution; Pollution Exposure; Review; Social Behavior; Social Cohesion; Systematic Review; Turbidity; Animal; Animal Behavior; Drug Effect; Physiology; Toxicity; Water Pollutant; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Fishes; Social Behavior; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Abiotic; Fish; Haze pollution; Invertebrates; Anthropogenic pollutants; Aquatic system; Chemical pollutants; Chemical pollution; Cohesion; Fish behavior; Group cohesions; Physiological stress; Posterior means; Sociability; Anthropogenic; heavy metal; inorganic compound; organic compound; anthropogenic source; behavioral response; chemical pollutant; ecological impact; fish; literature review; meta-analysis; pollution effect; anthropogenic pollutant; aquatic environment; chemical pollution; Cyprinidae; individual sociability; light exposure; meta analysis; metabolic stress; nonhuman; physiological stress; pollutant; pollution; pollution exposure; Review; social behavior; social cohesion; systematic review; turbidity; animal; animal behavior; drug effect; physiology; toxicity; water pollutant; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Fishes; Social Behavior; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This work was supported by a Natural Environment Research Council IAPETUS2 Doctoral Training Programme Scholarship to I.C.T., and Natural Environment Research Council Standard Grant NE/T008334/1 to S.S.K.",yes,"Alsop, Derek H., Metal uptake and acute toxicity in zebrafish: Common mechanisms across multiple metals, Aquatic Toxicology, 105, 3-4, pp. 385-393, (2011); Barcellos, Heloísa Helena De Alcântara, Aripiprazole prevents stress-induced anxiety and social impairment, but impairs antipredatory behavior in zebrafish, Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior, 189, (2020); Bartolini, Tiziana, Temperature influences sociality and activity of freshwater fish, Environmental Biology of Fishes, 98, 3, pp. 825-832, (2015); Bertram, Michael G., Endocrine-disrupting chemicals, Current Biology, 32, 13, pp. R727-R730, (2022); Bertram, Michael G., Frontiers in quantifying wildlife behavioural responses to chemical pollution, Biological Reviews, 97, 4, pp. 1346-1364, (2022); Birceanu, Oana, Modes of metal toxicity and impaired branchial ionoregulation in rainbow trout exposed to mixtures of Pb and Cd in soft water, Aquatic Toxicology, 89, 4, pp. 222-231, (2008); Borner, Karoline K., Turbidity affects social dynamics in Trinidadian guppies, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 69, 4, pp. 645-651, (2015); Brüning, Anika, Spotlight on fish: Light pollution affects circadian rhythms of European perch but does not cause stress, Science of the Total Environment, 511, pp. 516-522, (2015); Capriello, Teresa, Exposure to aluminium causes behavioural alterations and oxidative stress in the brain of adult zebrafish, Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology, 85, (2021); Chaput, Shayna Lee, Zebrafish (Danio rerio) shoaling in light and dark conditions involves a complex interplay between vision and lateral line, Behavioural Brain Research, 439, (2023)",,Elsevier Ltd,39341410,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206250677

Recent findings: Based on previous anthropogenic noise impact frameworks, it was possible to: clarify the impacts of noise on birds; optimise the existing frameworks with findings produced over 44 years; recategorise noise impacts into more appropriate categories, indicating which are the positive and negatives, as well as acute and chronic impacts caused by anthropogenic noise; provide a significant cluster model of anthropogenic noise impacts on avian species subdivided into impacts on ‘Behaviour’ and ‘Communication/Perception’ (Cluster 1) and ‘Physiology’ (Cluster 2); and show how avian hearing frequency range overlaps noise source frequency range. Summary: This research adopted the database of Peacock et al. [1, 2] regarding avian species due to its vast coverage across taxa. A systematic literature review of 50 peer-reviewed papers about anthropogenic noise impact on birds was undertaken. A Two-Step Cluster analysis was calculated, showing the data subdivided into two clusters. Cluster 1 (76.9%) showed behavioural responses mainly composed of negative and auditory perception and communication impacts, presenting positive or negative noise impacts.

Yet, there is still great uncertainty surrounding how different acoustic stimuli influence marine and freshwater (i.e., aquatic) communities. Despite capabilities to detect and produce sounds, aquatic invertebrates are among the most understudied taxa within the field of soundscape ecology. We conducted a meta-analysis to understand how sounds from various sources influence the behavior and physiology of aquatic invertebrates. We extracted 835 data points from 46 studies conducted in 15 countries. The resulting data included 50 species, a range of experimental conditions, and four sound categories: anthropogenic, environmental, synthetic, and music. We used meta-analytic multivariate mixed-effect models to determine how each sound category influenced aquatic invertebrates and if responses were homogeneous across taxa. Our analyses illustrate that anthropogenic noise and synthetic sounds have detrimental impacts on aquatic invertebrate behavior and physiology, and that environmental sounds have slightly beneficial effects on their behavior. Defence responses were the most impacted behaviors, while the most prominent physiological responses were related to biochemistry, genetics, and morphology. Additionally, arthropods and molluscs exhibited the most pronounced physiological responses to anthropogenic and synthetic noise. These findings support the conclusion that many invertebrate species are sensitive to changes in aquatic soundscapes, which can cause adverse or favorable consequences to individuals and populations, dependent on the sound source. This quantitative synthesis highlights the necessity of including marine and freshwater invertebrates in acoustic exposure studies, aquatic ecosystem assessments, and emerging noise pollution policies.","Acoustic Enrichment; Aquatic Invertebrates; Arthropods; Fitness Consequences; Global Change; Molluscs; Noise Pollution; Quantitative Synthesis; Soundscapes; Arthropod; Behavioral Response; Freshwater Ecosystem; Global Change; Marine Ecosystem; Meta-analysis; Mollusc; Noise Pollution; Physiological Response; Quantitative Analysis; Fresh Water; Sea Water; Adverse Event; Animal; Animal Behavior; Aquatic Species; Ecosystem; Invertebrate; Meta Analysis; Noise; Physiology; Sound; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Invertebrates; Noise; Seawater; Sound","arthropod; behavioral response; freshwater ecosystem; global change; marine ecosystem; meta-analysis; mollusc; noise pollution; physiological response; quantitative analysis; fresh water; sea water; adverse event; animal; animal behavior; aquatic species; ecosystem; invertebrate; meta analysis; noise; physiology; sound; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Invertebrates; Noise; Seawater; Sound","Funding: This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Hakai Institute; Liber Ero Foundation; Canadian Healthy Oceans Network (CHONe); University of Florida; University of Victoria; Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

However, Arctic industrialisation coupled with increasingly accessible ice-free waters means these species increasingly co-occur, and are exposed to, a number of potentially impactful activities, many of which are directly or indirectly associated with marine vessels. We conducted a systematic map, using five search databases, to ascertain the current level of understanding relating to how Arctic whales respond to marine vessels and vessel-associated activities. We identified a limited volume of literature (n = 169), and a disparity in volume between species, subpopulations, and vessel types. Several vessel types are increasingly present in the Arctic (e.g. cruise ships, fishing vessels), yet received limited consideration. Similarly, several endangered subpopulations have received little attention.

The core analyses are based on a focal Norwegian data set built on samples from 134 harbour porpoises caught incidentally in gillnet fisheries along the Norwegian coast during autumn 2016 and spring 2017. Two contrasting practices for interpretation of seasonal and ontogenetic characteristics of tooth growth layer formation resulted in significant age differences among spring samples of young porpoises and for older animals across seasons. In turn, these differences affected estimates of age at maturity and asymptotic lengths, respectively. We also found significant differences in male age at maturity between two well-documented maturity criteria and between mathematical estimators of age at maturity for both sexes. Two different criteria for corpus albicans classification furthermore resulted in different patterns of ovarian corpora accumulation, which may affect some estimates of fecundity rates and contaminant loads. Both corpora accumulation patterns were also found in reanalysed data from German and Greenlandic porpoises. Based on tabulated overviews of methodological choices made in previous harbour porpoise studies, we argue that several of the issues mentioned above have wider relevance and may affect the validity of meta-analyses as a tool for estimating harbour porpoise sensitivity to extrinsic pressures. Differences in cause of death (COD) composition between data sets can have a similar effect. We demonstrate this in a meta-analysis of published harbour porpoise pregnancy rates, showing significantly higher values for trauma-killed samples compared to samples comprising mixed COD categories. COD also affected the estimated impacts of three previously analysed extrinsic predictors as well as an added predictor for vessel noise levels. We discuss the potential contributions of methodological, biological and anthropogenic factors in shaping observed regional differences in estimates of harbour porpoise life history parameters.",Animal Experiment; Article; Autopsy; Body Mass; Breeding; Corpus Luteum; Data Interpretation; Electronic Spreadsheet; Fetus Growth; Lactation; Linear Regression Analysis; Mathematical Phenomena; Methodology; Nonhuman; Phocoena Phocoena; Porpoise; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Rate; Reproductive Procedure; Sexual Maturity; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Toothed Whale; Animal; Female; Fertility; Male; Norway; Phocoena; Physiology; Reproduction; Season; Sexual Maturation; Animals; Female; Fertility; Male; Reproduction; Seasons; Sexual Maturation,animal experiment; Article; autopsy; body mass; breeding; corpus luteum; data interpretation; electronic spreadsheet; fetus growth; lactation; linear regression analysis; mathematical phenomena; methodology; nonhuman; Phocoena phocoena; porpoise; pregnancy; pregnancy rate; reproductive procedure; sexual maturity; spatiotemporal analysis; toothed whale; animal; female; fertility; male; Norway; Phocoena; physiology; reproduction; season; sexual maturation; Animals; Female; Fertility; Male; Reproduction; Seasons; Sexual Maturation,"The project was funded by the FRAM centre flagship project \""The role of Harbour porpoise in Norwegian coastal communities\"" (project number 14808-03) and by the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research through the project \""The ecological role and importance of marine mammals\"" (project number 14392).The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis BUT encoureged publication of results in peer reviewed journals.

Many deployments fail to achieve management goals, which can result in negative ecological, environmental and socioeconomic consequences. AR performance is influenced by characteristics of the reef design and deployment location. To ensure the success of AR deployments in achieving set goals, risk evaluation of AR failure is necessary. Traditional risk assessments evaluate risks from the perspective of the activity impacting the surrounding environment and the associated organisms. Here we propose a new approach to risk evaluation, where we consider the risks that may influence the likelihood of the artificial reef deployment failing to achieve set goals. AR deployments commonly occur in areas exposed noise pollution, remain poorly understood and regulated. Applying a systematic literature review, this study has summarised and evaluated the known impacts of coastal noise and light pollution on fish and invertebrates. This data informed the development of a novel risk assessment to evaluate the likelihood of achieving AR deployments which successfully function as marine habitats when exposed to these pollutants. Risk mitigation strategies have also been explored to provide managers with the best practice advice when determining deployment location. The presented risk assessment can be employed for both planning and regulating purposes. It provides an efficient, repeatable assessment of the risks that can lead to AR failure and sets a defensible ecological standard for management decisions.",Anthropogenic Noise; Artificial Light; Artificial Reef; Fish; Invertebrates; Marine Management; Ecosystems; Environmental Management; Fish; Fisheries; Marine Pollution; Noise Pollution; Reefs; Anthropogenic Noise; Artificial Light; Artificial Reefs; Ecological Risks; Invertebrate; Light Pollution; Marine Environment; Marine Management; Risk Evaluation; Risks Assessments; Risk Assessment; Anthropogenic Source; Artificial Reef; Fish; Habitat Structure; Invertebrate; Light Effect; Light Pollution; Marine Environment; Mitigation; Noise Pollution; Risk Assessment,Ecosystems; Environmental management; Fish; Fisheries; Marine pollution; Noise pollution; Reefs; Anthropogenic noise; Artificial light; Artificial reefs; Ecological risks; Invertebrate; Light pollution; Marine environment; Marine management; Risk evaluation; Risks assessments; Risk assessment; anthropogenic source; artificial reef; fish; habitat structure; invertebrate; light effect; light pollution; marine environment; mitigation; noise pollution; risk assessment,Financial support was provided by the Centre for Marine Socioecology which allowed for the completion of this study.,yes,"Airoldi, Laura, Corridors for aliens but not for natives: Effects of marine urban sprawl at a regional scale, Diversity and Distributions, 21, 7, pp. 755-768, (2015); Amorim, M.

With over 270 million residents inhabiting urban areas in the United States, the socioecological consequences of racially targeted zoning, such as redlining, need to be considered in urban planning. There is a growing body of literature documenting the relationships between redlining and the inequitable distribution of environmental harms and goods, green space cover and pollutant exposure. However, it remains unknown whether historical redlining affects the distribution of urban noise or whether inequitable noise drives an ecological change in urban environments. Here we conducted a spatial analysis of how urban noise corresponds to the distribution of redlining categories and a systematic literature review to summarize the effects of noise on wildlife in urban landscapes. We found strong evidence to indicate that noise is inequitably distributed in redlined urban communities across the United States, and that inequitable noise may drive complex biological responses across diverse urban wildlife, reinforcing the interrelatedness of socioecological outcomes. These findings lay a foundation for future research that advances relationships between acoustic and urban ecology through centring equity and challenging systems of oppression in wildlife studies.","Animal; Human; Noise; Wild Animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Humans; Noise","animal; human; noise; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Humans; Noise","We thank M.\u2009McKenna for providing feedback on an early draft of the manuscript.

However, there is a lack of research on the combined effects of these environmental factors on life-history traits and fitness, and on how these interactions shape food resources and drive patterns of species persistence. Here, we systematically reviewed the literature and created a comprehensive framework of the mechanistic pathways by which urbanization affects fitness and thus favors certain species. We found that urbanization-induced changes in urban vegetation, habitat quality, spring temperature, resource availability, acoustic environment, nighttime light, and species behaviors (e.g., laying, foraging, and communicating) influence breeding choices, optimal time windows that reduce phenological mismatch, and breeding success. Insectivorous and omnivorous species that are especially sensitive to temperature often experience advanced laying behaviors and smaller clutch sizes in urban areas. By contrast, some granivorous and omnivorous species experience little difference in clutch size and number of fledglings because urban areas make it easier to access anthropogenic food resources and to avoid predation. Furthermore, the interactive effect of land-use change and UHI on species could be synergistic in locations where habitat loss and fragmentation are greatest and when extreme-hot weather events take place in urban areas. However, in some instances, UHI may mitigate the impact of land-use changes at local scales and provide suitable breeding conditions by shifting the environment to be more favorable for species' thermal limits and by extending the time window in which food resources are available in urban areas. As a result, we determined five broad directions for further research to highlight that urbanization provides a great opportunity to study environmental filtering processes and population dynamics.",Artificial Light At Night; Breeding Fitness; Environmental Filter; Food Resources; Land-use Change; Life-history Traits; Noise Pollution; Trophic Interaction; Urban Heat Island; Urbanization,,We thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments that improved the quality of the article.

Elevated levels of pollution are a major threat to biodiversity, yet there is no synthesis of their impact on many of the major ecosystem functions, including pollination. This ecosystem function is both particularly vulnerable as it depends on the fine-tuned interaction between plants and pollinators and hugely important as it underpins the flora of most habitats as well as food production. Here, we untangle the impact of air, light, and noise pollution on the pollination system by systematically evaluating and synthesizing the published evidence via a meta-analysis. We identified 58 peer-reviewed articles from three databases. Mixed-effects meta-regression models indicated that air pollution negatively impacts pollination. However, there was no effect of light pollution, despite previous studies that concentrated solely on pollinators suggesting a negative impact. Evidence for noise pollution was extremely limited. Unless action is taken to tackle air pollution, the capacity to support well-functioning diverse pollination systems will be compromised, with negative consequences for habitat conservation and food security.",Anthropogenic Disturbances; Ecosystem Functions And Services; Plant Reproductive Success; Pollinators; Pollutants; Synthesis,,"We are grateful to Tom Cavanaugh for his help in article screening.

This resulting noise may affect a range of species, eliciting masking, behavioral responses, and changes in acoustic repertoires. There is an urgency to understand in depth the potential effects of seismic surveys on marine ecosystems since the information available is still scarce. Using Scopus® and Web of Science™ 2023 Clarivate bibliographic databases, we systematically reviewed the scientific literature addressing seismic surveys’ effects on free-ranging marine fauna. The first selection of articles matching selected keywords yielded 680 articles from Scopus and 320 from Web of Science. Screening for research articles written in English investigating marine fauna in its natural environment and performing a quality assessment process resulted in selecting 31 articles since 2001. We found a trend of increasing research efforts in this field with a decrease after 2020 and a broad spectrum of journals that hosted the publications (31 papers published in 12 journals). Although several taxa are investigated, most studies focused on effects on marine mammals. There is a lack of research on diverse animal taxa, and no research papers compare the effects on different taxa along the food chain. Behavioral and physiological effects are the most found by authors in the field. However, observed behavioral changes cannot always be uniquely attributed to the exposure to seismic surveys, as many authors report the influence of other variables (e.g., environmental conditions) during the observations.",Fish; Invertebrates; Marine Birds; Marine Fauna; Marine Mammals; Seals; Seismic Surveys; Systematic Review,,"AA is funded by the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Sciences - OGS, the University of Trieste, and JASCO Applied Sciences.

Since the industrial revolution, human activities have become increasingly noisy, leading to both acute and chronic disturbance of a wide variety of animals. Chronic noise exposure can affect animals over their lifespan, leading to changes in species interactions and likely altering communities. However, the community-level impacts of chronic noise are not well-understood, which impairs our ability for effective mitigation. In this review, we address the effects of chronic noise exposure on communities and explore possible mechanisms underlying these effects. The limited studies on this topic suggest that noise can affect communities by changing the behavior and/or physiology of species in a community, which results in direct or knock-on consequences for other species in the ecosystem. Major knowledge gaps remain due to the logistically complex and financially expensive nature of the long-term studies needed to address these questions. By identifying these gaps and suggesting approaches to answer them, we provide a road map toward mitigating the effects of a noisy world.",Anthropogenic Noise; Behavior; Chronic; Community; Ecology,,"Funding text 1: This manuscript was conceived during an interdisciplinary workshop entitled “Allying Conservation & Welfare Research on the Impacts of Human-Generated Sounds on Wild & Captive Animals” funded by the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

These activities are mainly due to vehicular, air and sea transportation, thus causing possible repercussions on the fauna that exists there. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the possible consequences that these activities may have in the field of animal neurobehavior, with special emphasis on the species involved, the most common environment concerned, the noise source and the disturbance that is caused. This research includes articles published in the major databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, Web of Sciences); the online search yielded 1901 references. After selection, 49 articles (14 reviews and 35 original articles) were finally scrutinized. The main problems that were reported were in relation to movement, reproduction, offspring care and foraging. In live experiments carried out, the repercussions on the marine environment mainly concerned altered swimming, shallower descents, less foraging and an escape reaction for fear of cetaceans and fish. In birds, alterations in foraging, vocalizations and nests were noted; laboratory studies, on the other hand, carried out on small mammals, highlighted spatio-temporal cognitive alterations and memory loss.

Sounds play a fundamental role in the lives of amphibians, with species relying on acoustic communication for social and reproductive behaviour, and thus noise can potentially interfere with these activities. Here, we provide a literature review on the effects of anthropogenic noise on anuran amphibians, based on 32 studies (63 species from 14 families) that document noise-driven changes in species behaviour, physiology and ecology caused by urbanisation, transportation and energy production. Experimental and observational studies found evidence that both airborne and seismic anthropogenic noise influence anuran calling activity, with consequences in mate selection, and induce physiological changes including increased stress, suppressed immune function and colouration changes. Negative noise effects in species abundance and attendance over the reproductive season were reported. Even though adaptations and behavioural adjustments enable species to respond to these noises, it is yet to be understood whether these changes alleviate the negative impacts. Furthermore, collaborative efforts between scientists, stakeholders and private/public institutions are imperative to create conservation guidelines and legal instruments to be implemented during urban expansion projects and mitigate the effects of noise pollution on amphibian anurans.",Acoustic Communication; Behaviour; Conservation; Noise Pollution; Physiology,,"Funding text 1: We would like to thank Andreas Kindel, Maria João Ramos Pereira and Vinícius M.

The restrictions taken to slow down the spread of the virus impact socio-economic activities and the environment. A comprehensive review of these COVID-19 impacts on the ocean-human system is lacking. The current study fills this gap by synthesizing the environmental and socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global ocean by conducting a systemic scoping review of 92 published articles. From a geospatial perspective, the studies covered a total of 37 countries, mainly from Asia, Europe, and North America, with a particular focus on the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. From an environmental perspective, both positive and negative effects on global oceans were summarized. Notably, improved coastal water quality and reduced underwater noise were reported. On the other hand, the increasing COVID-19-related medical waste such as personal protective equipment leads to severe pollution, which threatens the marine ecosystem and wildlife. From a socioeconomic perspective, the impacts of the pandemic were negative throughout with marine tourism and the fishery industry being severely disrupted. Coastal communities suffered from loss of income, unemployment, inequalities and health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity for transformation of management and economic practices in order to save our ocean and boost progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14). Future research should include other sectors such as marine biodiversity, marine renewable energy, climate change, and blue economy development of Small Island Developing States.

Two reviews provided early insight and nuance into LTI impacts on birdlife but were published when road ecology experiments were still being developed. Four factors were identified to impact birds near roads: habitat quality, species-specific traits, traffic noise, and infrastructure. Although early work identified traffic noise as the main selective force, recent studies lend more support to habitat quality and infrastructure. However, this literature was deemed to possess low inferential strength given inconsistent data collection, inadequate management of confounding variables, limited inclusion of vehicle-free environments, short-term experimental timeframes, and use of methodologies susceptible to bias. A new experimental framework for better evaluation of the impact of roads on birdlife is proposed.

Despite these measures, the population has failed to make demonstrable progress toward recovery. Data and knowledge gaps exist, as well as high uncertainty in the recovery plan, regarding the impact and severity of identified threats on CIB health and recovery, particularly for threats driven by anthropogenic factors, and cumulative effects. These data deficiencies may hinder threat prioritization and conservation and management actions. Odontocete populations in similarly ecologically precarious situations may serve as research surrogates to help fill information gaps and guide future CIB research and conservation. Through a systematic review of CIB and selected surrogate species [St. Lawrence beluga (SLB), Hector’s dolphins (HD), and southern resident killer whales (SRKW)], we identify gaps associated with threats described and ranked in the CIB recovery plan. All threats identified by the National Marine Fisheries Services as “high”-concern to CIB recovery, except noise, are lower in publication volume compared to publications related to high concern threats in SLB and SRKW. “Medium” or “low” threats to CIB, such as prey reduction and contaminants, respectively, are identified as higher priority threats in surrogate populations. These topics have been more heavily researched for surrogates and suggests that synthesis of this work may help reduce uncertainty, to aid in informing management actions for CIB. Specifically, publishing volume suggests SLB and SRKW are valuable surrogates for understanding the impacts of noise, prey, and contaminants. Publishing volume is necessary to choose a surrogate, but is not sufficient. Surrogates were chosen based on physiological similarities to CIB as well as their comparable management situations. Therefore, these lower-ranked threats should be ranked more highly and researched specifically in regard to CIB. We use this review to offer management recommendations based on current CIB and surrogate literature regarding listed threats in the CIB recovery plan. Our analyses suggest that CIB may benefit from a revision to and elevation of some low and medium-concern threats such as contaminants, habitat degradation, and prey reduction.",Cook Inlet Beluga; Endangered Species; Hector’s Dolphin; Recovery; Southern Resident Killer Whale; St. Lawrence Beluga; Systematic Literature Review; Threat,,"We would like to thank Roderick C.

Therefore, the detection, recognition and correct understanding of acoustic signals are key factors in effective communication. The priority of acoustic communication is effectiveness rather than perfection, being effective avoids affecting the sound-based communication system of the species. One of the factors that can affect effective communication is the overlap in time and frequency during signal transmission, known as signal masking. One type of sound that can cause masking is anthropogenic noise, which is currently increasing due to urban growth and consequently motorized transportation and machinery. When exposed to anthropogenic noise, animals can use compensatory mechanisms to deal with sound masking, such as the modification of acoustic parameters of their acoustic signal. Here, we performed a meta-analysis investigating whether different taxa have a general tendency for changes in acoustic parameters due to anthropogenic noise, we used taxa and acoustic parameters available in the literature that met the minimum criteria to perform a meta-analysis. We hypothesized that animals exposed to anthropogenic noise use compensation mechanisms, such as changes in dominant, maximum or minimum frequencies, call duration, note duration and call rate to deal with masking. We performed a meta-analysis, which synthesized information from 73 studies comprising 82 species of three taxa: insects, anurans and birds. Our results showed that in the presence of anthropogenic noise, insects did not change the acoustic parameters, while anurans increased call amplitude and birds increased dominant frequency, minimum and maximum frequencies, note duration and amplitude of their songs. The different responses of the groups to anthropogenic noise may be related to their particularities in the production and reception of sound or to the differences in the acoustic parameters considered between the taxa and also the lack of studies in some taxa.",Animal Communication; Anthropophony; Auditory Masking; Plasticity; Sound Production; Terrestrial Fauna; Vocal Adjustments,,"Funding text 1: We are grateful to Marina H.

Road-related stressors have significant effects on both lotic and lentic habitats. While there are several systematic reviews that evaluate the effects of roads on lotic environments, there are none that consider their effects on lentic habitats only. We conducted a literature review to achieve two objectives: (1) to summarize the effects of roads on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of lentic environments; and (2) to identify biases and gaps in our current knowledge of the effects of roads on lentic habitats, so that we could find promising areas for future research. Our review found 172 papers published between 1970 and 2020. The most frequently studied stressors associated with roads included road salt and heavy metal contamination (67 and 43 papers, respectively), habitat fragmentation (37 papers), and landscape change (14 papers). These stressors can lead to alterations in conductivity and chloride levels, changes in lake stratification patterns, increases in heavy metal concentrations in water and organisms, and significant mortality as amphibians disperse across roadways. We also identified a variety of other stressors that may be understudied based on their frequency of appearance in our search results, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, road dust, increased accessibility, hydrological changes, noise pollution, dust suppressants, sedimentation, invasive species introductions, and water withdrawal. Our review indicated that there are strong geographic biases in published studies, with 57.0% examining North American sites and 30.2% examining European sites. Furthermore, there were taxonomic biases in the published literature, with most studies focusing on amphibians (41.7%), fish (15.6%), and macroinvertebrates (14.6%), while few considered zooplankton (8.3%), diatoms (7.3%), amoebas (5.2%), water birds (3.1%), reptiles (2.1%), and macrophytes (1.0%). Based on our review, we have identified promising areas for future research for each of the major stressors related to roadways. However, we speculate that rectifying the geographic and taxonomic bias of our current knowledge could significantly advance our understanding of the impacts of roads on lentic environments, thereby better informing environmental management of these important habitats.",Anthropogenic Stress; Habitat; Lakes; Lentic; Ponds; Roads; Chlorine Compounds; Dust; Ecosystems; Heavy Metals; Lake Pollution; Noise Pollution; Paper; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Roads And Streets; 'current; Anthropogenic Stress; Geographics; Global Population; Habitat; Knowledge Gaps; Lentic; Road; Systematic Assessment; Systematic Review; Lakes,Chlorine compounds; Dust; Ecosystems; Heavy metals; Lake pollution; Noise pollution; Paper; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Roads and streets; 'current; Anthropogenic stress; Geographics; Global population; Habitat; Knowledge gaps; Lentic; Road; Systematic assessment; Systematic Review; Lakes,"Students working on this project were supported by an Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant to D.K.G.; H.J.D. was supported by the Global Water Futures research program, which is funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund.",yes,"Algül, Fulya, Concentrations and sources of heavy metals in shallow sediments in Lake Bafa, Turkey, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Aliff, Meagan N., Anthropocene geochemistry of metals in sediment cores from the Laurentian Great Lakes, PeerJ, 2020, 3, (2020); Alin, Simone R., Effects of landscape disturbance on animal communities in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, Conservation Biology, 13, 5, pp. 1017-1033, (1999); Anderson, Rachel B., Human traffic and habitat complexity are strong predictors for the distribution of a declining amphibian, PLOS ONE, 14, 3, (2019); Arnott, Shelley E., Road Salt Impacts Freshwater Zooplankton at Concentrations below Current Water Quality Guidelines, Environmental Science and Technology, 54, 15, pp. 9398-9407, (2020); Bai, Junhong, Spatial distribution and ecological risk assessment of heavy metals in surface sediments from a typical plateau lake wetland, China, Ecological Modelling, 222, 2, pp. 301-306, (2011); Baldwin, Elizabeth A., Terrestrial habitat use by nesting painted turtles in landscapes with different levels of fragmentation, Northeastern Naturalist, 11, 1, pp. 41-48, (2004); Barbosa, A.

Both sensory pollutants are well known to affect animal behavior and physiology, which can lead to substantial ecological impacts. Most studies on noise or light pollution to date have focused on single stressor impacts, studying both pollutants in isolation despite their high spatial and temporal co-occurrence. However, few studies have addressed their combined impact, known as multisensory pollution, with the specific aim to assess whether the interaction between noise and light pollution leads to predictable, additive effects, or less predictable, synergistic or antagonistic effects. We carried out a systematic review of research investigating multisensory pollution and found 28 studies that simultaneously assessed the impact of anthropogenic noise and ALAN on animal function (e.g., behavior, morphology or life-history), physiology (e.g., stress, oxidative, or immune status), or population demography (e.g., abundance or species richness). Only fifteen of these studies specifically tested for possible interactive effects when both sensory pollutants were combined. Four out of eight experimental studies revealed a significant interaction effect, in contrast to only three out seven observational studies. We discuss the benefits and limitations of experimental vs. observational studies addressing multisensory pollution and call for more specific testing of the diverse ways in which noise and light pollution can interact to affect wildlife.",Antagonism; Anthropogenic Noise; Artificial Light At Night (alan); Emergent Properties; Multisensory Pollution; Synergism,,This study was supported by the ERC-Starting Grant— CITISENSE (802460).,yes,"Bulleri, Fabio, Harnessing positive species interactions as a tool against climate-driven loss of coastal biodiversity, PLOS Biology, 16, 9, (2018); Buxton, Rachel T., The relationship between anthropogenic light and noise in U.S. national parks, Landscape Ecology, 35, 6, pp. 1371-1384, (2020); Casasole, Giulia, Neither artificial light at night, anthropogenic noise nor distance from roads are associated with oxidative status of nestlings in an urban population of songbirds, Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology -Part A : Molecular and Integrative Physiology, 210, pp. 14-21, (2017); Crain, Caitlin Mullan, Interactive and cumulative effects of multiple human stressors in marine systems, Ecology Letters, 11, 12, pp. 1304-1315, (2008); Darling, Emily S., Quantifying the evidence for ecological synergies, Ecology Letters, 11, 12, pp. 1278-1286, (2008); Dominoni, Davide M., Multisensory pollution: Artificial light at night and anthropogenic noise have interactive effects on activity patterns of great tits (Parus major), Environmental Pollution, 256, (2020); Dominoni, Davide M., Why conservation biology can benefit from sensory ecology, Nature Ecology and Evolution, 4, 4, pp. 502-511, (2020); Ferraro, Danielle M., Combined effect of anthropogenic noise and artificial night lighting negatively affect Western Bluebird chick development, Condor, 122, 4, (2020); Environ Evid, (2017); Ginnaw, Georgina M., Effects of multiple stressors on fish shoal collective motion are independent and vary with shoaling metric, Animal Behaviour, 168, pp. 7-17, (2020)",,Frontiers Media S.A.,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121346518

However, it is unclear whether public policy-making in the countries that present the same concern. We used the Brazilian environmental licensing legislation as a case study to investigate whether governments have addressed the scientific advances on the effects of anthropogenic noise on cetaceans. The study was based on a systematic review of the literature on the impacts of anthropogenic noise on cetaceans, and a survey of the environmental licensing reports related to the construction of shipping facilities and seismic activity. None of these reports evaluated the potential impacts on cetacean acoustics, and 59.6% were based solely on a review of the literature.

Since there are few prototype turbines and mooring systems of these deepwater, floating offshore wind energy facilities (OWFs) currently deployed, their effects on the marine environment are speculative. Using the available scientific literature concerning appropriate analogs, including fixed-bottom OWFs, land-based wind energy facilities, wave and tidal energy devices, and oil and gas platforms, we conducted a qualitative systematic review to estimate the potential environmental effects of deepwater, floating OWFs during operation, as well as potential mitigation measures to address some of the effects. We evaluated six categories of potential effects: changes to atmospheric and oceanic dynamics due to energy removal and modifications, electromagnetic field effects on marine species from power cables, habitat alterations to benthic and pelagic fish and invertebrate communities, underwater noise effects on marine species, structural impediments to wildlife, and changes to water quality. Our synthesis of 89 articles selected for the review suggests that many of these potential effects could be mitigated to pose a low risk to the marine environment if developers adopt appropriate mitigation strategies and best-practice protocols. This review takes the necessary first steps in summarizing the available information on the potential environmental effects of deepwater, floating OWFs and can serve as a reference document for marine scientists and engineers, the energy industry, permitting agencies and regulators of the energy industry, project developers, and concerned stakeholders such as coastal residents, conservationists, and fisheries.",Deepwater Floating Offshore Wind Energy; Environmental Impacts Analysis; Impact Assessment; Mitigation; Renewable Energy; Electromagnetic Fields; Environmental Impact Assessments; Offshore Oil Well Production; Tidal Power; Water Quality; Wind Power; Deepwater Floating; Deepwater Floating Offshore Wind Energy; Energy; Environmental Impact Analysis; Impact Assessments; Marine Environment; Mitigation; Off-shore Wind Energy; Potential Effects; Renewable Energies; Environmental Impact; Deep Water; Electrochemical Method; Environmental Effect; Equipment; Floating Offshore Structure; Habitat Fragmentation; Marine Ecosystem; Marine Environment; Mitigation; Mooring System; Seafloor Mapping; Stakeholder; Strategic Environmental Assessment; Water Quality; Wind Power; Wind Turbine; Invertebrata,Electromagnetic fields; Environmental impact assessments; Offshore oil well production; Tidal power; Water quality; Wind power; Deepwater floating; Deepwater floating offshore wind energy; Energy; Environmental impact analysis; Impact assessments; Marine environment; Mitigation; Off-shore wind energy; Potential effects; Renewable energies; Environmental impact; deep water; electrochemical method; environmental effect; equipment; floating offshore structure; habitat fragmentation; marine ecosystem; marine environment; mitigation; mooring system; seafloor mapping; stakeholder; strategic environmental assessment; water quality; wind power; wind turbine; Invertebrata,"Funding text 1: This work was supported by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Environmental Studies Program, Washington, DC under Agreement Number #M16AC00023.

Although wildlife can generally alter their communication to accommodate many types of natural noise (e.g. wind, wave action, heterospecific communication), noise pollution from anthropogenic sources pushes the limits of wildlife communication flexibility by causing loud, low-pitched and near-continuous interference. Because responses to noise pollution are variable and taxa specific, multi-species risk assessments and mitigation are not currently possible. We conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize noise pollution effects on terrestrial wildlife communication. Specifically, we assessed: (a) the impacts of noise pollution on modulation of call rate, duration, amplitude and frequency (including peak, minimum and maximum frequency); and (b) the literature on anthropogenic noise pollution by region, taxa, study design and disturbance type. Terrestrial wildlife (results driven by avian studies) generally respond to noise pollution by calling with higher minimum frequencies, while they generally do not alter the amplitude, maximum frequency, peak frequency, duration and rate of calling. The literature on noise pollution research is biased towards birds, population-level studies, urban noise sources and study systems in North America. Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals the ways in which wildlife can alter their signals to contend with anthropogenic noise, and discusses the potential fitness and management consequences of these signal alterations. This information, combined with an identification of current research needs, will allow researchers and managers to better develop noise pollution risk assessment protocols and prioritize mitigation efforts to reduce anthropogenic noise.",Acoustic Masking; Anthropogenic Sound; Global Change; Sound Pollution; Soundscapes; Wildlife Communication; Anthropogenic Effect; Gross National Product; Meta-analysis; National Park; Noise Pollution; Risk Assessment; Strategic Approach; Terrestrial Environment; Wild Population; North America,anthropogenic effect; Gross National Product; meta-analysis; national park; noise pollution; risk assessment; strategic approach; terrestrial environment; wild population; North America,"This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project number ND02394.

Shipping, resource exploration, and infrastructure development have increased the anthrophony (sounds generated by human activities), whereas the biophony (sounds of biological origin) has been reduced by hunting, fishing, and habitat degradation. Climate change is affecting geophony (abiotic, natural sounds). Existing evidence shows that anthrophony affects marine animals at multiple levels, including their behavior, physiology, and, in extreme cases, survival.

Among these changes are those in the acoustic environment caused by anthropogenic noise, which can affect both animals and humans. In many species, acoustic communication plays a crucial role to maintain social relationships by exchanging information via acoustic signals. However, how species relying on acoustic communication differ in their adjustments to anthropogenic noise is little understood. Yet, this is crucial because protecting species effectively depends on our capability to predict how species differ in their response to human-induced environmental changes. Using a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis, we quantified differences in adjustments of acoustic signals to anthropogenic noise among species. The effect sizes included in the analysis were obtained from noise exposure experiments, as only carefully controlled experiments allow to establish cause-and-effect relationships. We found that animals changed acoustic signals when exposed to noise, but the magnitude and the direction of adjustments differed among species. Given the importance of communication in the animal kingdom, these adjustments can affect social relationships in many species. The diversity of responses among species highlights the necessity to assess the effect of environmental stressors not only for a few species, because an effect may be positive in one species but negative in another depending on the species’ biology. Thus, an effective conservation approach to protect different species is to preserve natural soundscapes of ecosystems to which species have adapted to by reducing or mitigating the emission of anthropogenic noise into the environment.","Animal Behaviour; Anthrophony; Conservation; Global Change; Human-induced Environmental Change; Pollution; Soundscape; Environmental Pollutants; Anthropogenic Source; Bioacoustics; Global Change; Induced Response; Meta-analysis; Nature Conservation; Noise Pollution; Signaling; Acoustics; Adaptation; Adverse Event; Animal; Ecosystem; Human; Meta Analysis; Noise; Pollutant; Acoustics; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Noise","anthropogenic source; bioacoustics; global change; induced response; meta-analysis; nature conservation; noise pollution; signaling; acoustics; adaptation; adverse event; animal; ecosystem; human; meta analysis; noise; pollutant; Acoustics; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Noise",,no,"Sexual Selection, (1994); Barber, Jesse Rex, The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 25, 3, pp. 180-189, (2010); Bee, Mark A., Size assessment in simulated territorial encounters between male green frogs (Rana clamitans), Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 45, 3-4, pp. 177-184, (1999); Bee, Mark A., Auditory masking of anuran advertisement calls by road traffic noise, Animal Behaviour, 74, 6, pp. 1765-1776, (2007); Bent, Adam M., Anthropogenic noise disrupts mate searching in Gryllus bimaculatus, Behavioral Ecology, 29, 6, pp. 1271-1277, (2018); Boncoraglio, Giuseppe, Habitat structure and the evolution of bird song: A meta-analysis of the evidence for the acoustic adaptation hypothesis, Functional Ecology, 21, 1, pp. 134-142, (2007); Bonett, Douglas G., Confidence Intervals for Standardized Linear Contrasts of Means, Psychological Methods, 13, 2, pp. 99-109, (2008); Bonett, Douglas G., Meta-Analytic Interval Estimation for Standardized and Unstandardized Mean Differences, Psychological Methods, 14, 3, pp. 225-238, (2009); Borenstein, Michael T., Introduction to Meta-Analysis, pp. 1-421, (2009); Borenstein, Michael T., Basics of meta-analysis: I2 is not an absolute measure of heterogeneity, Research Synthesis Methods, 8, 1, pp. 5-18, (2017)",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,33289307,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096990645

Human population growth and associated changes in urbanization, transportation, and resource extraction all contribute to anthropogenic noise and are predicted to increase in the coming decades. Wildlife exposure to anthropogenic noise is expected to rise correspondingly. Data collected through field research are uniquely important in advancing understanding of the real-world repercussions of human activity on wildlife. We, therefore, performed a systematic review of literature published from 2008 to 2018 that reported on field investigations of anthropogenic noise impacts. We evaluated publication metrics (e.g., publication rates and journal type), geographical distribution of studies, study subject, and methods used. Research activity increased markedly over the assessment period. However, there was a pronounced geographical bias in research, with most being conducted in North America or Europe, and a notable focus on terrestrial environments. Fewer than one-fifth of terrestrial studies were located in rural areas likely to experience urbanization by 2030, meaning data on ecosystems most likely to be affected by future changes are not being gathered. There was also bias in the taxonomic groups investigated. Most research was conducted on birds and aquatic mammals, whereas terrestrial mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates received limited attention. Almost all terrestrial studies examined diurnal species, despite evidence that nocturnality is the prevailing animal activity pattern. Nearly half the studies investigated effects of road or urban noise; the bulk of research was restricted to functional, rather than physiological or demographic consequences. Few experimental studies addressed repercussions of long-term exposure to anthropogenic noise or long-term postexposure effects, and multiple noise types or levels were rarely compared. Tackling these knowledge gaps will be vital for successful management of the effects of increasing wildlife exposure to anthropogenic noise.",Contaminación Por Ruido; Contaminación Sonora; Disturbance; Fauna; Noise Pollution; Perturbación; Sound Pollution; Urbanización; Urbanization; Wildlife; 噪音污染; 城市化; 声污染; 干扰; 野生生物; Anthropogenic Effect; Human Activity; Noise Pollution; Physiological Response; Population Growth; Trend Analysis; Amphibia; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Reptilia; Sonora; Adverse Event; Animal; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Europe; Human; Noise; North America; Animals; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Noise,anthropogenic effect; human activity; noise pollution; physiological response; population growth; trend analysis; Amphibia; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Reptilia; Sonora; adverse event; animal; ecosystem; environmental protection; Europe; human; noise; North America; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Noise,We thank F.

These effects on individuals can extend to inducing population- and ecosystem-wide alterations, especially when MNP impacts functionally important species, such as keystone predators and habitat forming species.

Indeed, many studies have shown the impacts of anthropogenic noise and concluded that it is potentially a threat to the persistence of many species. The present work is a systematic map of the evidence of the impacts of all anthropogenic noises (industrial, urban, transportation, etc.) on biodiversity. This report describes the mapping process and the evidence base with summary figures and tables presenting the characteristics of the selected articles. Methods: The method used was published in an a priori protocol. Searches included peer-reviewed and grey literature published in English and French. Two online databases were searched using English terms and search consistency was assessed with a test list. Supplementary searches were also performed (using search engines, a call for literature and searching relevant reviews). Articles were screened through three stages (titles, abstracts, full-texts). No geographical restrictions were applied. The subject population included all wild species (plants and animals excluding humans) and ecosystems. Exposures comprised all types of man-made sounds in terrestrial and aquatic media, including all contexts and sound origins (spontaneous or recorded sounds, in situ or laboratory studies, etc.). All relevant outcomes were considered (space use, reproduction, communication, etc.). Then, for each article selected after full-text screening, metadata were extracted on key variables of interest (species, types of sound, outcomes, etc.). Review findings: Our main result is a database that includes all retrieved literature on the impacts of anthropogenic noise on species and ecosystems, coded with several markers (sources of noise, species concerned, types of impacts, etc.). Our search produced more than 29,000 articles and 1794 were selected after the three screening stages (1340 studies (i.e. primary research), 379 reviews, 16 meta-analyses). Some articles (n = 19) are written in French and all others are in English. This database is available as an additional file of this report. It provides an overview of the current state of knowledge. It can be used for primary research by identifying knowledge gaps or in view of further analysis, such as systematic reviews. It can also be helpful for scientists and researchers as well as for practitioners, such as managers of transportation infrastructure. Conclusion: The systematic map reveals that the impacts of anthropogenic noises on species and ecosystems have been researched for many years. In particular, some taxonomic groups (mammals, birds, fishes), types of noise (transportation, industrial, abstract) and outcomes (behavioural, biophysiological, communication) have been studied more than others. Conversely, less knowledge is available on certain species (amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates), noises (recreational, military, urban) and impacts (space use, reproduction, ecosystems). The map does not assess the impacts of anthropogenic noise, but it can be the starting point for more thorough synthesis of evidence. After a critical appraisal, the included reviews and meta-analyses could be exploited, if reliable, to transfer the already synthesized knowledge into operational decisions to reduce noise pollution and protect biodiversity.",Acoustic Stimuli; Anthropogenic Sounds; Auditory Masking; Ecosystems; Man-made Sounds; Natural Habitats; Species Loss; Traffic; Urbanization,,"Funding text 1: The current systematic map is managed by the UMS Pat-rimoine Naturel joint research unit funded by the French Biodiversity Agency (OFB), the National Scientific Research Center (CNRS) and the National Museum of Natural History (MNHN), in a partnership with INRAE.

Anthropogenic noise is recognized as a global source of environmental pollution and adequate conservation and management strategies are urgently needed. It becomes therefore critical to identify the reproductive traits that render a species vulnerable to acoustic disturbances, and the types of anthropogenic noise that are most likely to impact reproduction. Here, we provide predictions about noise impact on fish reproduction following a two-step approach: first, we grouped documented effects of noise into three mechanistic categories: stress, masking and hearing-loss, and test which type of noise (continuous vs intermittent and regular vs irregular) was most likely to produce a significant response in each category with either a meta-analysis or a quantitative review, depending on data availability. Second, we reviewed existing literature to predict which reproductive traits would render fish most sensitive to stress, masking and hearing-loss. In step one, we concluded that continuous sounds with irregular amplitude and/or frequency-content (e.g. heavy ship traffic) were most likely to cause stress, and continuous sounds were also most likely to induce masking and hearing-loss. From step two we concluded that the vulnerability of a species to noise-induced stress will mainly depend on: (1) its potential to reallocate reproduction to more quiet times or locations, and (2) its vulnerability to masking and hearing-loss mainly on the function of sound communication in its reproductive behaviour. We discuss in which stages of reproduction fish are most likely to be vulnerable to anthropogenic noise based on these findings.

However, most research considers only whether noise pollution has an impact, ignoring that individuals within a species or population exhibit substantial variation in responses to stress. Here, we first outline how intrinsic characteristics (e.g., body size, condition, sex, and personality) and extrinsic factors (e.g., environmental context, repeated exposure, prior experience, and multiple stressors) can affect responses to environmental stressors. We then present the results of a systematic search of the anthropogenic-noise literature, identifying articles that investigated intraspecific variation in the responses of nonhuman animals to noise. This reveals that fewer than 10% of articles (51 of 589) examining impacts of noise test experimentally for intraspecific variation in responses; of those that do, more than 75% report significant effects. We assess these existing studies to determine the current scope of research and findings to-date, and to provide suggestions for good practice in the design, implementation, and reporting of robust experiments in this field. We close by explaining how understanding intraspecific variation in responses to anthropogenic noise is crucial for improving how we manage captive animals, monitor wild populations, model species responses, and mitigate effects of noise pollution on wildlife.

However, such single studies cannot provide holistic quantitative assessments on the potential effects of noise across species. Using a multi-level phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis, we provide the first holistic quantitative analysis on the effects of anthropogenic noise. We found that noise affects many species of amphibians, arthropods, birds, fish mammals, molluscs and reptilians. Interestingly, phylogeny contributes only little to the variation in response to noise. Thus, the effects of anthropogenic noise can be explained by the majority of species responding to noise rather than a few species being particularly sensitive to noise.

A concomitant increase in underwater noise has been reported in several regions around the globe. Given the important role sound plays in the life functions of marine mammals, research on the potential effects of vessel noise has grown—in particular since the year 2000. We provide an overview of this literature, showing that studies have been patchy in terms of their coverage of species, habitats, vessel types, and types of impact investigated. The documented effects include behavioral and acoustic responses, auditory masking, and stress. We identify knowledge gaps: There appears a bias to more easily accessible species (i.e., bottlenose dolphins and humpback whales), whereas there is a paucity of literature addressing vessel noise impacts on river dolphins, even though some of these species experience chronic noise from boats. Similarly, little is known about the potential effects of ship noise on pelagic and deep-diving marine mammals, even though ship noise is focused in a downward direction, reaching great depth at little acoustic loss and potentially coupling into sound propagation channels in which sound may transmit over long ranges. We explain the fundamental concepts involved in the generation and propagation of vessel noise and point out common problems with both physics and biology: Recordings of ship noise might be affected by unidentified artifacts, and noise exposure can be both under- and over-estimated by tens of decibel if the local sound propagation conditions are not considered. The lack of anthropogenic (e.g., different vessel types), environmental (e.g., different sea states or presence/absence of prey), and biological (e.g., different demographics) controls is a common problem, as is a lack of understanding what constitutes the ‘normal’ range of behaviors. Last but not least, the biological significance of observed responses is mostly unknown. Moving forward, standards on study design, data analysis, and reporting are badly needed so that results are comparable (across space and time) and so that data can be synthesized to address the grand unknowns: the role of context and the consequences of chronic exposures.",Auditory Masking; Behavioral Response; Chronic Noise Exposure; Commercial Shipping; Marine Mammal; Marine Watercraft; Ship Noise Emission,,,no,"Accardo, Corey M., Sightings of a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) in the Gulf of Maine and its interactions with other baleen whales, Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 19, pp. 23-30, (2018); Interim Report of the Technical Workshop on Manatee Population Biology Manatee Population Research Report no 10, (1992); Aguilar-Soto, Natacha, Does intense ship noise disrupt foraging in deep-diving cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris)?, Marine Mammal Science, 22, 3, pp. 690-699, (2006); Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference and Exhibition on Underwater Acoustics, (2014); Akamatsu, Tomonari, Evidence of nighttime movement of finless porpoises through Kanmon Strait monitored using a stationary acoustic recording device, Fisheries Science, 74, 5, pp. 970-975, (2008); Akkaya, Aylin, The effects of marine traffic on the behaviour of Black Sea harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena relicta) within the Istanbul Strait, Turkey, PLOS ONE, 12, 3, (2017); Andersen, Signe May, Behavioural responses of harbour seals to human-induced disturbances, Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems, 22, 1, pp. 113-121, (2012); Anderwald, Pia, Displacement responses of a mysticete, an odontocete, and a phocid seal to construction related vessel traffic, Endangered Species Research, 21, 3, pp. 231-240, (2013); André, Michel, Sperm whale long-range echolocation sounds revealed by ANTARES, a deep-sea neutrino telescope, Scientific Reports, 7, (2017); Andrew, Rex K., Ocean ambient sound: Comparing the 1960s with the 1990s for a receiver off the California coast, Acoustic Research Letters Online, 3, pp. 65-70, (2002)",,Frontiers Media S.A. info@frontiersin.org,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074274048

Many species have been documented to display behavioral and physiological responses to increased noise pollution in our oceans, but the majority of this research has focused on higher trophic organisms. Recently, investigations assessing the impacts of changing soundscapes on entire aquatic ecosystems have begun. To understand the impacts of underwater noise on invertebrate communities, a meta-analysis was conducted on the behavioral and physiological impacts of noise on invertebrates. A systematic review of the literature revealed 1, 105 potential studies, which 25 were extracted for data analysis. The studies resulted in 473 data points evaluating the impacts of a plethora of acoustic stimuli on a wide range of marine invertebrate taxa. Here, two acoustic stimuli (ship noise and seismic surveys) were further broken down into behavioral and physiological parameters.

Yet, little is known about how aquatic noise affects marine communities. To determine the implications that changes to the soundscape may have on fishes, a meta-analysis was conducted focusing on the ramifications of noise on fish behavior and physiology. Our meta-analysis identified 42 studies that produced 2,354 data points, which in turn indicated that anthropogenic noise negatively affects fish behavior and physiology. The most predominate responses occurred within foraging ability, predation risk, and reproductive success. Additionally, anthropogenic noise was shown to increase the hearing thresholds and cortisol levels of numerous species while tones, biological, and environmental noise were most likely to affect complex movements and swimming abilities. These findings suggest that the majority of fish species are sensitive to changes in the aquatic soundscape, and depending on the noise source, species responses may have extreme and negative fitness consequences. As such, this global synthesis should serve as a warning of the potentially dire consequences facing marine ecosystems if alterations to aquatic soundscapes continue on their current trajectory.","Aquatic Noise; Fish Behavior; Fish Physiology; Fitness Consequences; Global Change; Noise Pollution; Soundscape; Systematic Review; Fish; Global Change; Marine Ecosystem; Meta-analysis; Noise Pollution; Physiology; Pollution Effect; Pisces; Animal; Animal Behavior; Ecosystem; Environmental Exposure; Meta Analysis; Noise; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Environmental Exposure; Fishes; Noise","fish; global change; marine ecosystem; meta-analysis; noise pollution; physiology; pollution effect; Pisces; animal; animal behavior; ecosystem; environmental exposure; meta analysis; noise; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Environmental Exposure; Fishes; Noise","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Canada Research Chairs Program, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Liber Ero Foundation, Canadian Healthy Oceans Network, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund.

Here, a meta-analysis following a conservative approach is used to understand how dredging-related stressors, including suspended sediment, contaminated sediment, hydraulic entrainment and underwater noise, directly influence the effect size and the response elicited in fish across all aquatic ecosystems and all life-history stages. This is followed by an in-depth review summarizing the effects of each dredging-related stressor on fish. Across all dredging-related stressors, studies that reported fish mortality had significantly higher effect sizes than those that describe physiological responses, although indicators of dredge impacts should endeavour to detect effects before excessive mortality occurs. Studies examining the effects of contaminated sediment also had significantly higher effect sizes than studies on clean sediment alone or noise, suggesting additive or synergistic impacts from dredging-related stressors. The early life stages such as eggs and larvae were most likely to suffer lethal impacts, while behavioural effects were more likely to occur in adult catadromous fishes. Both suspended sediment concentration and duration of exposure greatly influenced the type of fish response observed, with both higher concentrations and longer exposure durations associated with fish mortality. The review highlights the need for in situ studies on the effects of dredging on fish which consider the interactive effects of multiple dredging-related stressors and their impact on sensitive species of ecological and fisheries value.

Synthesising a coherent understanding of the biological consequences of noise from this literature is challenging. Taxonomic groups vary in auditory capabilities. A wide range of noise sources and exposure levels occur, and many kinds of biological responses have been observed, ranging from individual behaviours to changes in ecological communities. Also, noise is one of several environmental effects generated by human activities, so researchers must contend with potentially confounding explanations for biological responses. Nonetheless, it is clear that noise presents diverse threats to species and ecosystems and salient patterns are emerging to help inform future natural resource-management decisions. We conducted a systematic and standardised review of the scientific literature published from 1990 to 2013 on the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife, including both terrestrial and aquatic studies. Research to date has concentrated predominantly on European and North American species that rely on vocal communication, with approximately two-thirds of the data set focussing on songbirds and marine mammals. The majority of studies documented effects from noise, including altered vocal behaviour to mitigate masking, reduced abundance in noisy habitats, changes in vigilance and foraging behaviour, and impacts on individual fitness and the structure of ecological communities. This literature survey shows that terrestrial wildlife responses begin at noise levels of approximately 40 dBA, and 20% of papers documented impacts below 50 dBA. Our analysis highlights the utility of existing scientific information concerning the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife for predicting potential outcomes of noise exposure and implementing meaningful mitigation measures. Future research directions that would support more comprehensive predictions regarding the magnitude and severity of noise impacts include: broadening taxonomic and geographical scope, exploring interacting stressors, conducting larger-scale studies, testing mitigation approaches, standardising reporting of acoustic metrics, and assessing the biological response to noise-source removal or mitigation. The broad volume of existing information concerning the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife offers a valuable resource to assist scientists, industry, and natural-resource managers in predicting potential outcomes of noise exposure.","Acoustic Metrics; Acoustics; Behaviour; Conservation; Fitness; Human Disturbance; Masking; Mitigation; Noise Pollution; Physiology; Vocal Communication; Animal; Ecosystem; Human; Noise; Research; Wild Animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Ecosystem; Humans; Noise; Research","animal; ecosystem; human; noise; research; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Ecosystem; Humans; Noise; Research",,no,"Acoustical Terminology, (1994); Quantities and Procedures for Description and Measurement of Environmental Sound Part 4 Noise Assessment and Prediction of Long Term Community Response, (2005); Amoser, Sonja, Noise emission during the first powerboat race in an Alpine lake and potential impact on fish communities, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 116, 6, pp. 3789-3797, (2004); Anderson, Paul A., Sound, stress, and seahorses: The consequences of a noisy environment to animal health, Aquaculture, 311, 1-4, pp. 129-138, (2011); André, Michel, Low-frequency sounds induce acoustic trauma in cephalopods, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 9, 9, pp. 489-493, (2011); Arévalo, J.

The current North American paradigm for regulating activities that may result in behavioural responses identifies received levels (RL) of sound at which individuals are predicted to display significant behavioural responses (often termed harassment). The recurrent conclusion about the need for considering context of exposure, in addition to RL, when assessing probability and severity of behavioural responses led us to conduct a systematic literature review (370 papers) and analysis (79 studies, 195 data cases). The review summarized the critical and complex role of context of exposure. The analysis emphasized that behavioural responses in cetaceans (measured via a linear severity scale) were best explained by the interaction between sound source type (continuous, sonar, or seismic/explosion) and functional hearing group (a proxy for hearing capabilities). Importantly, more severe behavioural responses were not consistently associated with higher RL and vice versa. This indicates that monitoring and regulation of acoustic effects from activities on cetacean behaviour should not exclusively rely upon generic multispecies RL thresholds. We recommend replacing the behavioural response severity score with a response/no response dichotomous approach that can represent a measure of impact in terms of habitat loss and degradation.",Behaviour; Cetaceans; Dolphins; Noise; Received Level; Regulations; Whales; Behavioral Response; Dolphin; Feeding Behavior; Growth Regulator; Habitat Loss; Hearing; Literature Review; Noise; Paradigm Shift; Vocalization; Whale; Wild Population; Cetacea; Mammalia,behavioral response; dolphin; feeding behavior; growth regulator; habitat loss; hearing; literature review; noise; paradigm shift; vocalization; whale; wild population; Cetacea; Mammalia,"C.

According to the World Health Organization, anthropogenic noise is one of the most hazardous forms of anthropogenically driven environmental change and is recognized as a major global pollutant. However, crucial advances in the rapidly emerging research on noise pollution focus exclusively on single aspects of noise pollution, e.g. on behaviour, physiology, terrestrial ecosystems, or on certain taxa. Given that more than two-thirds of our planet is covered with water, there is a pressing need to get a holistic understanding of the effects of anthropogenic noise in aquatic ecosystems. We found experimental evidence for negative effects of anthropogenic noise on an individual’s development, physiology, and/or behaviour in both invertebrates and vertebrates. We also found that species differ in their response to noise, and highlight the potential underlying mechanisms for these differences. Finally, we point out challenges in the study of aquatic noise pollution and provide directions for future research, which will enhance our understanding of this globally present pollutant.",Aquatic Ecosystems; Behaviour; Communication; Environmental Change; Physiology; Anthropogenic Effect; Aquatic Ecosystem; Behavioral Response; Biodiversity; Communication Behavior; Environmental Change; Invertebrate; Nature-society Relations; Noise Pollution; Physiological Response; Terrestrial Ecosystem; Vertebrate; World Health Organization; Invertebrata; Vertebrata; Animal; Aquatic Species; Ecosystem; Human; Human Activities; Noise; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Ecosystem; Human Activities; Humans; Invertebrates; Noise; Vertebrates,anthropogenic effect; aquatic ecosystem; behavioral response; biodiversity; communication behavior; environmental change; invertebrate; nature-society relations; noise pollution; physiological response; terrestrial ecosystem; vertebrate; World Health Organization; Invertebrata; Vertebrata; animal; aquatic species; ecosystem; human; human activities; noise; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Ecosystem; Human Activities; Humans; Invertebrates; Noise; Vertebrates,,no,"Chr Stenseth, Nils Chr, Ecological effects of climate fluctuations, Science, 297, 5585, pp. 1292-1296, (2002); Walther, Gian Reto, Ecological responses to recent climate change, Nature, 416, 6879, pp. 389-395, (2002); Burden of Disease from Environmental Noise, (2011); Andrew, Rex K., Ocean ambient sound: Comparing the 1960s with the 1990s for a receiver off the California coast, Acoustic Research Letters Online, 3, pp. 65-70, (2002); Hildebrand, John A., Anthropogenic and natural sources of ambient noise in the ocean, Marine Ecology Progress Series, 395, pp. 5-20, (2009); Biology of Marine Mammals, (1999); Popper, Arthur N., Rethinking sound detection by fishes, Hearing Research, 273, 1-2, pp. 25-36, (2011); Ladich, Friedrich, Diversity in fish auditory systems: One of the riddles of sensory biology, Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 4, MAR, (2016); Wong, Bob B.M., Behavioral responses to changing environments, Behavioral Ecology, 26, 3, pp. 665-673, (2015); Kight, Caitlin R., How and why environmental noise impacts animals: An integrative, mechanistic review, Ecology Letters, 14, 10, pp. 1052-1061, (2011)",,Royal Society of London sales@royalsoc.ac.uk,27534952,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982291523

These species not only take advantage of the prevailing sounds but also contribute to the soundscape through their own vocalizations. Certain sounds have been shown to have negative effects on marine species, resulting in disrupted communication and unbalanced predator-prey interactions. Unfortunately, the vast majority of soundscape studies are biased towards marine mammals, and only recently has attention been directed towards the potential repercussions for fishes. In an attempt to determine the implications that changes to the soundscape may have on the fishes, a meta-analysis was conducted focusing primarily on the role that anthropogenic noises may play in altering fish behavior and physiology. The review identified 3,174 potentially relevant papers of which were 27 used. The analysis indicates that anthropogenic noise has an adverse effect on marine and freshwater fish behavior and physiology. These findings suggest that although certain species may be more susceptible to anthropogenic noise than others, the vast majority of fish have the potential to be negatively affected by noise pollution.",Fish; Mammals; Noise Pollution; Physiology; Adverse Effect; Anthropogenic Noise; Freshwater Fishes; Habitat Selection; Marine Mammals; Marine Species; Meta Analysis; Predator-prey Interaction; Marine Communication,Fish; Mammals; Noise pollution; Physiology; Adverse effect; Anthropogenic noise; Freshwater fishes; Habitat selection; Marine mammals; Marine species; Meta analysis; Predator-prey interaction; Marine communication,,no,"Amoser, Sonja, Diversity in noise-induced temporary hearingloss in otophysine fishes, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 113, 4 I, pp. 2170-2179, (2003); Anderson, Paul A., Evoked potential audiogram of the lined seahorse, Hippocampus erectus (Perry), in terms of sound pressure and particle acceleration, Environmental Biology of Fishes, 91, 3, pp. 251-259, (2011); Graphclick Version 3 0 Computer Software, (2008); Acoustic Communication, (2003); Boyle, Megan A., Evaluation of the reliability and validity of GraphClick as a data extraction program, Computers in Human Behavior, 29, 3, pp. 1023-1027, (2013); Codarin, Antonio, Effects of ambient and boat noise on hearing and communication in three fish species living in a marine protected area (Miramare, Italy), Marine Pollution Bulletin, 58, 12, pp. 1880-1887, (2009); Crovo, Jenna A., Stress and auditory responses of the otophysan fish, cyprinella venusta, to road traffic noise, PLOS ONE, 10, 9, (2015); Davidson, John W., The effects of aquaculture production noise on the growth, condition factor, feed conversion, and survival of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Aquaculture, 288, 3-4, pp. 337-343, (2009); Quantitative Methods for Psychology, (2015); Mad Meta Analysis with Mean Differences, (2014)",,Acoustical Society of America publish@aip.org,,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011092694

Through a meta-analysis we investigated the relative importance of biological and contextual factors predisposing species to shift their singing/calling frequencies in response to anthropogenic noise. We gathered data from 36 studies, synthesizing information on more than 160 experiments and 60 bird and anuran species. To estimate the breadth of frequency shift, we calculated a standardized effect size using Hedges' g. We fitted a multilevel linear mixed-effect model on g as the dependent variable weighted by its inverse variance, with typical frequency, body mass, experimental condition, and noise source type as independent terms. Our results reveal broader shifts in smaller bird species when compared with bigger species, an effect that was emphasized in the low-frequency component of the song spectrum. Birds increased their dominant frequencies when confronted to anthropogenic noise, whereas anurans were less prone to such shifts. Human-altered acoustic environments can be considered a novel selective force impelling change to the communication patterns of many vocalizing species.",Acoustic Adaptation Hypothesis; Acoustic Masking; Anthropogenic Noise; Bioacoustics; Frequency Shift; Soundscape; Adaptation; Anthropogenic Effect; Bioacoustics; Body Mass; Experimental Study; Frequency Analysis; Frog; Meta-analysis; Noise; Song; Anura; Aves,adaptation; anthropogenic effect; bioacoustics; body mass; experimental study; frequency analysis; frog; meta-analysis; noise; song; Anura; Aves,,no,"Barber, Jesse Rex, The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 25, 3, pp. 180-189, (2010); Iucn Red List for Birds, (2012); Species, (2015); Borenstein, Michael T., Introduction to Meta-Analysis, pp. 1-421, (2009); Principles of Animal Communication, (1998); Brumm, Henrik, The impact of environmental noise on song amplitude in a territorial bird, Journal of Animal Ecology, 73, 3, pp. 434-440, (2004); Brumm, Henrik, Signalling through acoustic windows: Nightingales avoid interspecific competition by short-term adjustment of song timing, Journal of Comparative Physiology A: Neuroethology, Sensory, Neural, and Behavioral Physiology, 192, 12, pp. 1279-1285, (2006); Brumm, Henrik, Acoustic Communication in Noise, Advances in the Study of Behavior, 35, pp. 151-209, (2005); Brumm, Henrik, Noise-dependent song amplitude regulation in a territorial songbird, Animal Behaviour, 63, 5, pp. 891-897, (2002); Model Selection and Multimodel Inference A Practical Information Theoretic Approach, (2002)",,Oxford University Press jnl.info@oup.co.uk,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989951139

In recent years, concerns have been raised over the biological impacts of this activity, particularly for marine mammals. While exploration occurs in the waters of at least fifty countries where marine turtles are present, the degree of threat posed by seismic surveys is almost entirely unknown. To investigate this issue, a mixed-methods approach involving a systematic review, policy comparison and stakeholder analysis was employed and recommendations for future research were identified. This study found that turtles have been largely neglected both in terms of research and their inclusion in mitigation policies. Few studies have investigated the potential for seismic surveys to cause behavioural changes or physical damage, indicating a crucial knowledge gap. Possible ramifications for turtles include exclusion from critical habitats, damage to hearing and entanglement in seismic survey equipment. Despite this, the policy comparison revealed that only three countries worldwide currently include turtles in their seismic mitigation guidelines and very few of the measures they specify are based on scientific evidence or proven effectiveness. Opinions obtained from stakeholder groups further highlight the urgent need for directed, in-depth empirical research to better inform and develop appropriate mitigation strategies. As seismic surveying is becoming increasingly widespread and frequent, it is important and timely that we evaluate the extent to which marine turtles, a taxon of global conservation concern, may be affected.",Airgun; Anthropogenic Noise; Mitigation; Policy; Sound; Stakeholder Analysis; Anthropogenic Effect; Behavioral Response; Conservation Management; Empirical Analysis; Hydrocarbon Exploration; Marine Ecosystem; Risk Assessment; Seismic Survey; Stakeholder; Turtle; Cheloniidae; Mammalia; Testudines,anthropogenic effect; behavioral response; conservation management; empirical analysis; hydrocarbon exploration; marine ecosystem; risk assessment; seismic survey; stakeholder; turtle; Cheloniidae; Mammalia; Testudines,"The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable and insightful comments that improved our manuscript.

Underwater noise from shipping is increasingly recognized as a significant and pervasive pollutant with the potential to impact marine ecosystems on a global scale. We reviewed six regional case studies as examples of recent research and management activities relating to ocean noise in a variety of taxonomic groups, locations, and approaches. However, as no six projects could ever cover all taxa, sites and noise sources, a brief bibliometric analysis places these case studies into the broader historical and topical context of the peer-reviewed ocean noise literature as a whole. The case studies highlighted emerging knowledge of impacts, including the ways that non-injurious effects can still accumulate at the population level, and detailed approaches to guide ocean noise management. They build a compelling case that a number of anthropogenic noise types can affect a variety of marine taxa. Meanwhile, the bibliometric analyses revealed an increasing diversity of ocean noise topics covered and journal outlets since the 1940s. This could be seen in terms of both the expansion of the literature from more physical interests to ecological impacts of noise, management and policy, and consideration of a widening range of taxa. However, if our scientific knowledge base is ever to get ahead of the curve of rapid industrialization of the ocean, we are going to have to identify naïve populations and relatively pristine seas, and construct mechanistic models, so that we can predict impacts before they occur, and guide effective mitigation for the most vulnerable populations.",Anthropogenic; Conservation; Ecology; Marine; Ocean Noise; Policy; Shipping; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Freight Transportation; Knowledge Based Systems; Marine Pollution; Public Policy; Ships; Anthropogenic; Anthropogenic Noise; Bibliometric Analysis; Management Activities; Marine; Mechanistic Models; Ocean Noise; Scientific Knowledge Base; Oceanography; Anthropogenic Source; Conservation Management; Ecological Impact; Industrialization; Management Practice; Marine Ecosystem; Noise Pollution; Policy Approach; Shipping; Underwater Noise,Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Freight transportation; Knowledge based systems; Marine pollution; Public policy; Ships; Anthropogenic; Anthropogenic noise; Bibliometric analysis; Management activities; Marine; Mechanistic models; Ocean noise; Scientific knowledge base; Oceanography; anthropogenic source; conservation management; ecological impact; industrialization; management practice; marine ecosystem; noise pollution; policy approach; shipping; underwater noise,"The authors would like to thank the organizers of the 3rd International Marine Conservation Congress for convening a symposium on anthropogenic noise.

Here, we begin by explaining why invertebrates are likely to be affected byanthropogenic noise, briefly reviewing theircapacity for hearing and providing evidence that they are capable of evolutionary adaptation and behavioural plasticityin response to natural noise sources. We then discuss the importance of quantifying accurately and fully both auditory ability and noise content, emphasizing considerations of direct relevance to how invertebrates detect sounds. We showcase how studying invertebrates can help with the behavioural bias in the literature, the difficulties in drawing strong, ecologically valid conclusions and the need for studies on fitness impacts. Finally, we suggest avenues of future research using invertebrates that would advance our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic noise. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

One of the major threats to biodiversity is infrastructural development. We used meta-analyses to study the effects of infrastructure proximity on mammal and bird populations. Data were gathered from 49 studies on 234 mammal and bird species. The main response by mammals and birds in the vicinity of infrastructure was either avoidance or a reduced population density. The mean species abundance, relative to non-disturbed distances (MSA), was used as the effect size measure. The impact of infrastructure distance on MSA was studied using meta-analyses. Possible sources of heterogeneity in the results of the meta-analysis were explored with meta-regression. Mammal and bird population densities declined with their proximity to infrastructure. The effect of infrastructure on bird populations extended over distances up to about 1. km, and for mammal populations up to about 5. km. Mammals and birds seemed to avoid infrastructure in open areas over larger distances compared to forested areas, which could be related to the reduced visibility of the infrastructure in forested areas. We did not find a significant effect of traffic intensity on the MSA of birds. Species varied in their response to infrastructure. Raptors were found to be more abundant in the proximity of infrastructure whereas other bird taxa tended to avoid it. Abundances were affected at variable distances from infrastructure: within a few meters for small-sized mammals and up to several hundred meters for large-sized mammals. Our findings show the importance of minimizing infrastructure development for wildlife conservation in relatively undisturbed areas. By combining actual species distributions with the effect distance functions we developed, regions sensitive to infrastructure development may be identified. Additionally, the effect distance functions can be used in models in support of decision making on infrastructure planning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Biodiversity Loss; Bird Abundance; Infrastructure; Mammal Abundance; Mean Species Abundance; Meta-analysis; Meta-regression; Roads; Traffic Intensity; Abundance; Anthropogenic Effect; Bird; Human Activity; Infrastructural Development; Infrastructure Planning; Mammal; Meta-analysis; Population Decline; Population Density; Road Transport; Species Conservation,abundance; anthropogenic effect; bird; human activity; infrastructural development; infrastructure planning; mammal; meta-analysis; population decline; population density; road transport; species conservation,,no,"Adams, Lowell W., Small mammal use of an interstate highway median strip., Journal of Applied Ecology, 21, 1, pp. 175-178, (1984); Alkemade, Rob, GLOBIO3: A framework to investigate options for reducing global terrestrial biodiversity loss, Ecosystems, 12, 3, pp. 374-390, (2009); Andrews, A., Fragmentation of habitat by roads and utility corridors: a review, Australian Zoologist, 26, 3-4, pp. 130-141, (1990); Angold, Penelope G., The impact of a road upon adjacent heathland vegetation: Effects on plant species composition, Journal of Applied Ecology, 34, 2, pp. 409-417, (1997); Arnqvist, Göran, Meta-analysis: synthesizing research findings in ecology and evolution, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 10, 6, pp. 236-240, (1995); Auerbach, Nancy A., Effects of roadside disturbance on substrate and vegetation properties in arctic tundra, Ecological Applications, 7, 1, pp. 218-235, (1997); Ballard, Warren B., Arctic fox, Alopex lagopus, den densities in the Prudhoe Bay oil field, Alaska, Canadian Field-Naturalist, 114, 3, pp. 453-456, (2000); Ballasus, Hauke, The impact of power lines on field selection and grazing intensity of wintering white-fronted- and bean geese Anser albifrons, A. fabalis, Journal fur Ornithologie, 138, 2, pp. 215-228, (1997); Barrios, Luis, Behavioural and environmental correlates of soaring-bird mortality at on-shore wind turbines, Journal of Applied Ecology, 41, 1, pp. 72-81, (2004); Barrows, Cameron W., Boundary processes between a desert sand dune community and an encroaching suburban landscape, Biological Conservation, 131, 4, pp. 486-494, (2006)",,,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954819367

However, there exists no comprehensive examination of the effects of human disturbance on ungulate escape responses. I conducted a comprehensive review of studies measuring Artiodactyl escape responses (e.g., flight initiation distance, distance moved) to experimental harassment by humans and vehicles, and meta-analyses aimed at predictive questions about the impact of human disturbance on ungulate behavior under an optimization framework. I found evidence across studies that ungulates pay attention to approacher behavior, have greater perceptions of risk when disturbed in open habitats, and females or groups with young offspring show greater flight responses than adult groups. Increased group size and the presence of hunting showed weak but positive heterogeneous effects on flight behavior both between and within species. Humans on foot were more evocative than other stimuli (vehicles, noises). Populations in areas with higher levels of human traffic showed reduced wariness but a lack of alternative sites to move to may explain some of this effect. Hunted populations showed significantly greater flight responses than non-hunted populations. Finally, I suggest five factors to consider when forming predictive models of ungulate flight behavior: (1) how seasonal variation in reproductive status and body condition effects wariness, (2) the relative impacts of lethal and non-lethal human contact, and (3) unique natural history traits that may cause differences in flight behavior between populations, (4) the availability of alternative sites, and (5) shorter distances between feeding sites and refugia can reduce the impact of other factors on flight responses. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
